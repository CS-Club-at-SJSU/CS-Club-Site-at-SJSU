Next Friday (11/30) a group of business students working with Kovio is sponsoring a hackathon in the student union. Participants will team up at (or before) the hackathon. The goal will be to come up with an idea for using the near-field communication feature of the Samsung Galaxy S3 (or any Android phone that has NFC). Near-field communication is the ability for phones to exchange information simply by "bumping" into each other. The ideal team will consist of a developer and entrepreneur. While the developer creates the app (using Eclipse with the Android and NFC plugins) the entrepreneur creates a business plan. 24 hours later all teams will do 5 minute presentations of their ideas. The winning teams win cash and phones. Go to http://sjsu-nfc-hackathon.com/ to get details on programming Androids in Java, judging criteria, registration, etc.
