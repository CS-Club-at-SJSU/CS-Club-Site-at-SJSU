I'd like to remind everyone that the [StartupSJSU Sponsored Hackathon](http://entusic.com/artist?event=3&id=3) is coming up on **April 6th, 7th, and 8th** (Friday, Saturday, Sunday) and you should all definitely come! I for one am super excited for it, as I plan on trying to put together an entire web-based business in one weekend. We'll see how it goes.

As another reminder, this event is *not* an official CS club event. However I've spoken with some of the people involved with it and it seems like it's perfectly legitimate, with some really cool sponsor perks and prizes. Unfortunately at this time it seems like the hackerspace we will use, being the Spartan Dining Commons, will close daily at 10pm and open sometime around 8 or 9 am (can anyone confirm those times?) and so as a result this won't be an all-nighter hackathon. I gather that the organizers are trying to secure spaces in the nearby student dormitories for hackers to sleep (and maybe work) during the late night hours. Personally I plan to leave and come back, rested and ready.

Here was the original post:

> Entrepreneurial society and I are delighted to invite you to StartupSJSU, a weekend long hackathon and business plan competition. The event will help you to build a product and start businesses with teams from different disciplines. This is the perfect place if you have a business idea but do not know where to start. Or you can just come and code!

> The price for the event is just $25 (a lot for students I know, but we are covering unlimited food) and there will be prizes! Thanks to our sponsors, 1st place team wins $300, 2nd wins $150. An iPad will be given away for those who built a cool app using SendHub API.
