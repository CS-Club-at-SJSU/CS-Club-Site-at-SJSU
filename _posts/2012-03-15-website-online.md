Welcome to the new SJSU CS Club website! Stay tuned for more updates.

Thanks to [Johnathon](https://github.com/36mbMonster) and [Colin](https://github.com/Lanzaa) for their help with getting the initial layout up and online.

Thanks to the CS club and the MSDNAA for hosting the recent Hackathon that got me motivated to do this.
