On a sort of related note to the room monitor list, we want to know how many people who've not graduated are "members," meaning in this case people who would potentially attend recruiting, programming or other related events. So I made a [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1k0mrLGbFxU1Fchb6jjvW95upLj2xtu7cgmqBWdQmgm0/viewform) for people to submit your names for us to get as close to an official headcount as we're likely to get.
