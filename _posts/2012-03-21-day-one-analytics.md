When the site went live on Monday, I 'snuck in' some Google Analytics code. We now have the first report for the first 24 hours (actually more like 36) and I thought you all might be interested to see the breakdown.

We had 135 unique visitors, generating 501 page views over 165 visits. The average duration for a visit was 3 minutes and 3 seconds. Here are the juicy stats for each unique visitor:

# Operating System
* Windows: 92 (55.76%)
* Macintosh: 45 (27.27%)
* Linux: 16 (9.70%)
* We also had 1 FreeBSD user and 11 mobile device users, with iOS the clear winner among them.

# Browser
* Chrome: 100 (60.61%)
* Firefox: 39 (23.64%)
* Safari: 13 (7.88%)
* Internet Explorer: 7 (4.24%)
* 6 other browsers, including 1 Opera user, who I can only assume is also the FreeBSD holdout. ;)

# Service Provider
* Comcast: 68 (41.21%)
* SJSU: 40 (24.24%)
* AT&T: 4 (2.42%).
* And a scattering among the rest, including 3 from eBay and 3 from Yahoo!, which I found interesting.

# Country
* As expected, the majority where from the US - 160 (96.97%)
* China: 2 (1.21%)
* Egypt: 1 (0.61%)
* India: 1 (0.61%)
* Unknown: 1 (0.61%)

That's all of the interesting statistics. There's all sorts of other analytics that Google will give you for free (and more if you pay, I think, but I haven't looked in to that yet) but they are mostly geared towards advertising.

I hope you found this as interesting as I did! Let me know if you'd like an update later on, when we have more data.
