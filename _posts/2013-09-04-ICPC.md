As a few of you may be aware, the CS Club is officially a member organization of the ACM. One of the benefits of this is that we are able to compete in the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Competition) each year.

Last year, [Colin Blower](https://www.facebook.com/colin.blower.5?directed_target_id=17292528133), Sai Datta and myself competed in a team. It's basically an all day Saturday event, for the Northern California regionals. It's a lot of fun, and can be as hardcore as casual as you want it to be.

For those interested in the ICPC coming up on November 2nd:

I've created a signup [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1hR6gRxn2r5T2GPHScUm7h3Dx3xU0ioDHN7VGOk42t-o/viewform). Absolutely anybody can participate, at any grade level or level of competitiveness. I'll send out an email with extra information to people who signed up, and we can set up a time for everybody to form teams of three with people of a similar interest level.
