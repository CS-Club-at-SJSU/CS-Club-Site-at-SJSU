As a few of you may be aware, the CS Club is officially a member organization of the ACM. One of the benefits of this is that we are able to compete in the ICPC (International Collegiate Programming Competition) each year.

Last year, [Colin Blower](https://www.facebook.com/colin.blower.5?directed_target_id=17292528133), Sai Datta and myself competed in a team. It's basically an all day Saturday event, going to be on November 2nd for the Northern California regionals. It's a lot of fun, and can be as hardcore as casual as you want it to be. If you're interested in competing, keep the date open and a signup form for it will be coming if you'd like to find people to team up with.
