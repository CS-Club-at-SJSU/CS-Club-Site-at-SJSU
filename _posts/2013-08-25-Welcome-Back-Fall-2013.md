Hi everybody! Welcome back to the semester. A lot of you may have forgotten about this group, since all event information has been posted on the Facebook group (you can join that by searching for San Jose State Computer Science Club on facebook) or on the board in the club room. However, as there is a significant minority of people who don't want to use Facebook, all information about events and general club updates will be posted here as well. This is in addition to other posts that get sent to this group, such as job listings that Dr. Pierce forwards to the group. So be ready for more posts to this group.Â 

If you don't want to get an email notification of every post, you can go to the page for this group [CS Club Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sjsucsclub) and changing your settings to get a daily digest, for example. That will allow you to get information from here without getting bombarded by emails.
