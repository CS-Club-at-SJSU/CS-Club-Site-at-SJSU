[Note: Job postings are still going to happen in this group if they contact me and presumably Dr. Pierce as well, as he's the one who traditionally has posted to this group the most. These will be in addition to the direct club announcements from me and the other officers for this year. And now is the actual listing as I received it.]

My name is Bhavya and I work at Symantec. In my team we have a opening for DevOps roles and would like to post the job opening. Though the roles says 5 years of experience but we are open for new grads as well. Students can send their resumes directly at nuk_ops@symantec.com. 

Below is the job description:
