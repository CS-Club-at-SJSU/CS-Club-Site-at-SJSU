Dr. Richard Stallman, Founder of the GNU Project and the Free Software Foundation
will be giving a talk this Thursday, November 21, 2013 at [Washington Square 
Hall Room 109](http://www.cs.sjsu.edu/colloquium/flyers/2013/stallman.html).  

There many threats to freedom in the digital society. They include
massive surveillance, censorship, digital handcuffs, nonfree software 
that controls users, and the War on Sharing. Other threats come from use
of web services. Finally, we have no positive right to do anything in the Internet;
every activity is precarious, and can continue only as long as companies 
are willing to cooperate with it.
