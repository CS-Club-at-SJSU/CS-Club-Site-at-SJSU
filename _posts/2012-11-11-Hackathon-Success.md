Thank you to everyone who made it out to the Barracuda Hackathon, without you guys this event would have not been as fun! We had a great showing and the event was an uber-success! Thanks to Barracuda who sponsored this event and brought us a wicked amount of food!

I'm still recovering from being awake for 34 hours straight, but it was worth it. My team's bot only made it to the second round, but it put a great effort and lost to a pretty strong bot.

Well, onto to the results:

* First Place: Cystek
* Second Place: Where is Bala?
* Third Place: GoForIt

An honorable mention to David Alves and his Move Faster bot. Everyone expected to see it in the finals, but due to some technical difficulties, it didn't happen. All-in-all a great event!

This will just be a start of a great partnership of Barracuda and SJSU.
