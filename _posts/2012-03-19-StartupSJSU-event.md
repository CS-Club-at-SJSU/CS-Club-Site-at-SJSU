Entrepreneurial society and I are delighted to invite you to StartupSJSU, a weekend long hackathon and business plan competition. The event will help you to build a product and start businesses with teams from different disciplines. This is the perfect place if you have a business idea but do not know where to start. Or you can just come and code!

The price for the event is just $25 (a lot for students I know, but we are covering unlimited food) and there will be prizes! Thanks to our sponsors, 1st place team wins $300, 2nd wins $150. An iPad will be given away for those who built a cool app using SendHub API.
