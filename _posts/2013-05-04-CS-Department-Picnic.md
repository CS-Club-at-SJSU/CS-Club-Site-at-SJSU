There is a department picnic with the CS faculty, staff, and students. This will be a great time to unwind and relax right before finals hit. You must sign up at the department office. Also, the cost is $6, however the CS Club will help fund your ticket if you want to go! Just come by the club and we will walk over to the department window and pay $3 of the cost!
