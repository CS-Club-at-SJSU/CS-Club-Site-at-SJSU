Hello All:

I would like to first and foremost welcome everyone to a new semester. Our goal is to help revive the drive in the CS Club. One of the ways we can accomplish this is by offering a tutoring service in the club. For that we need volunteer tutors. If you feel that you can spare some time, please [sign up](http://tinyurl.com/csclubtutorsignup). Thank you!
