Do you have an original project in mind that you are passionate about (NLP, AI, Robotics, etc.)? Then you are strongly encouraged to consider the following opportunity: Work your hardest to realize it throughout this Winter Break, then, early during the Spring 2015 semester on Thursday, February 5, 2014, be ready to present your ideas and prototypes!!! This will be an excellent way to help you gain more insight, potential assistance from faculty or peers, and you could plausibly win an awesome prize!!! For more details please visit the Facebook [event](https://www.facebook.com/events/830910516955329/) page.
