The Computer Science Club at SJSU strives to gather and motivate computer
science students. It provides a forum for sharing opportunities, knowledge and
to network. Also it allows students with this common interest to have some fun!

We are located in MacQuarrie Hall (MH) 227 at SJSU (1 Washington Square,
San Jose). The club is open to all students throughout most school days as a
study room.
