None yet, you should add some!

## How to add a quote

You could
[fork the website on github](https://github.com/CS-Club-at-SJSU/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU)
and edit that way, but you could also simply [edit this page directly](https://github.com/CS-Club-at-SJSU/CS-Club-Site-at-SJSU/edit/master/shout.md).

Try to keep the formatting consistent.
